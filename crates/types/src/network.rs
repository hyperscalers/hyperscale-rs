//! Network message traits and class classification.
//!
//! These traits mark types as network messages for serialization and routing.
//!
//! # Class Levels
//!
//! Messages are classified by what stalls if delivery is delayed, into five
//! tiers from most to least urgent:
//!
//! 1. **Consensus** — BFT round-blocking messages whose loss can only be
//!    recovered by a view-change timeout (`BlockHeader`, `BlockVote`).
//!
//! 2. **`BlockCompletion`** — DA gap-closure for the *current* proposal. Delay
//!    extends the voting window but the round still completes
//!    (`GetTransactions`, `GetLocalProvisions`, `GetFinalizedWaves` on the
//!    pending-block path).
//!
//! 3. **`CrossShardProgress`** — Execution and finalization across shards.
//!    Delay stalls cross-shard execution but local consensus continues
//!    (`StateProvision`, `ExecutionVotes`, `ExecutionCertificates`,
//!    `CommittedBlockHeader` gossip).
//!
//! 4. **Recovery** — Catch-up traffic. Steady-state volume is zero
//!    (`GetBlock`, `GetSync`, `GetRemoteHeader`).
//!
//! 5. **Bulk** — High-volume best-effort with fetch fallback
//!    (`TransactionGossip`).
