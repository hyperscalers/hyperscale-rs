//! Network message traits and concrete wire types.
//!
//! [`MessageClass`], [`NetworkMessage`], [`Request`], and [`GossipMessage`]
//! mark types as network messages for serialization, routing, and `QoS`
//! ordering. Concrete messages live in submodules grouped by transport
//! semantics:
//!
//! - [`gossip`]: best-effort one-to-many fanout via gossipsub.
//! - [`notification`]: targeted one-way pushes that don't expect a reply.
//! - [`request`] / [`response`]: paired request-reply messages used by the
//!   per-payload fetch protocols.
//!
//! All messages are encoded with HBOR (not serde). Per-message wrappers
//! exist mostly to register typed handlers via the network registry; the
//! files in each subdirectory are thin HBOR wire-types — see the
//! containing struct for field semantics.
//!
//! # Class Levels
//!
//! Messages are classified by what stalls if delivery is delayed, into five
//! tiers from most to least urgent:
//!
//! 1. **Consensus** — shard round-blocking messages whose loss can only be
//!    recovered by a view-change timeout (`BlockHeader`, `BlockVote`).
//!
//! 2. **`BlockCompletion`** — DA gap-closure for the *current* proposal. Delay
//!    extends the voting window but the round still completes
//!    (`GetTransactions`, `GetLocalProvisions`, `GetFinalizations` on the
//!    pending-block path).
//!
//! 3. **`CrossShardProgress`** — Execution and finalization across shards.
//!    Delay stalls cross-shard execution but local consensus continues
//!    (`Provisions`, `ExecutionVotes`, `ExecutionCertificates`,
//!    `CertifiedBlockHeader` gossip).
//!
//! 4. **Recovery** — Catch-up traffic. Steady-state volume is zero
//!    (`GetBlock`, `GetSync`, `GetRemoteHeader`).
//!
//! 5. **Bulk** — High-volume best-effort with fetch fallback
//!    (`TransactionGossip`).
